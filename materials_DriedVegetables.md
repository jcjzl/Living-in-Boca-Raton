# Materials of Chinese Food:Dried Vegetables

We were living in another scene before the refrigerator was born. Vegetables was sown by season. In the harvest season, summer or autumn, a great amount of vegetables beyond the requirements were ripe in a short time. Fresh vegetables must be air dried so that they can be stored safely. In northern China, the dried vegetables help people getting through the long winter. 



But not all dried vegetables are made because of season. Actually dried vegetables have some special flavours then the fresh vegetables, a little bit like the smell of sunshine, soil and air, sometimes the smell of hometown.
