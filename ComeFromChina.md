# Come from China



Perhaps we would never come to Boca Raton if our daughter, Munks, isn’t here. Five years ago, Munks became a PhD student of FAU(Florida Atlantic University), and now she will finish her doctoral dissertation defense. She invited her parents, we couple, to attend her defense.



We come from Beijing, China. Last time to visit Boca is 3 years ago, Spring festival of 2015. We arrived Boca in midnight, 7 Oct, lived in a homestay before her defense. After 6 days, we moved to her appartment and enjoy the whole 20 days happy family life.



She was always busy even though she had finished the defense, to write back to paper reviewers to explain the arguments, applicate a research funding, looking for a post doctoral position and so on. As her mom, I can’t give any help except cooking some traditional Chinese dishes which are  her favorite.         



Chinese believe in that food is God, so wherever they move to, they will bring the traditional food to the new place. There is a Chinatown in Fort Lauderdale, a town in south of Boca Raton. Once the family got together, the top priority is go to Chinatown for shopping. As the saying goes, smart housewife can’t cook a meal without rice.

Shopping list with bilingual items



All of these food materials will be cooked to dishes.



Food can recall one’s memories about the past, especially the happy feeling of childhood. My duty is to change these materials to dishes and let family feels happy.
