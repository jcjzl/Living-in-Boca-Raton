# Living in Boca Raton

## Come from China

Perhaps we would never come to Boca Raton if our daughter, Munks, isn’t here. Five years ago, Munks became a PhD student of FAU(Florida Atlantic University), and now she will finish her doctoral dissertation defense. She invited her parents, we couple, to attend her defense.
