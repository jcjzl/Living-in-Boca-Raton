Tofu can be cooked alone or with other ingredients. You can get various dishes by using different cooking method, such as salad, frying, soup, stew and so on.

### Soybean Paste

I lived in country with my grandparents when I was a child. I still remember that there was a jar which was full of fermented soybean paste in the yard. From time to time grandma  stirred the paste with a stick during the period of fermenting and the paste gave off a special smell. Many years later, I buy the bean paste from supermarket but I never meet the same smell again.



My grandma made the soybean paste in the open air without fermentation bacteria, but in factory, the paste is made in room and the fermentation bacteria is necessary.



In northern China, some uncooked fresh vegetables dipping in soybean paste is an everyday dish in summer.



Like soy sauce, soybean paste can serve as salt when cooking  with rich flavour and temping reddish brown color.
