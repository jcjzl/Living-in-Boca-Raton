# Chinese Dishes[1]: 素什锦

I beg leave to explain the dish name 素什锦(su4 shi2 jin3) before describing its cooking process. 



素 means vegetarian diet, i.e. eating non-animal food. 素 is not equal vegetables, as what I presented ahead: gluten, mushroom, soybean and its products, fresh or dried vegetables, these are all 素. its antonym is 荤(hun1), means animal food, sometimes means dirty language.    



什锦 is a word with two Chinese characters, it means some different things mixed together. It can be used as a noun, like 素什锦, means some non-animal food getting together. It also can be used as a adjective, such as 什锦糖果(assorted candy), means many kinds of candy getting together.
